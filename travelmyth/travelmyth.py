There are several Xbox models available in the market, including the Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. The Xbox Series X is the latest and most powerful console, while the Xbox Series S is a more affordable option that still offers great performance. The Xbox One is the previous generation console, but it still has a large library of games available to play.\n\nBefore purchasing an Xbox, you may want to consider factors such as your budget, the types of games you want to play, and whether you want to play games in 4K resolution. Once you have decided on a console, you can purchase it from a retailer or directly from the Xbox website. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns!"},{"role":"user","content":"Which models are 4K?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Both the Xbox Series X and Xbox One X support 4K resolution gaming. The Xbox Series S, on the other hand, supports up to 1440p resolution gaming, but it can upscale games to 4K. It's worth noting that in order to take advantage of 4K gaming, you'll need a 4K TV or monitor that supports HDR (High Dynamic Range) and HDMI 2.0 or higher."}],
